    "\n",
    "Population-level health surveys play a central role in epidemiology and public health research by enabling the study of chronic disease prevalence and associated risk factors at scale. This notebook presents a **reproducible, end-to-end predictive modeling pipeline** applied to the BRFSS 2015 Diabetes Health Indicators dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis focuses on **supervised classification of diabetes status** using behavioral, demographic, and self-reported health indicators. The pipeline includes data quality assessment, preprocessing, feature engineering, class imbalance considerations, and the implementation of multiple classification algorithms. Model performance is evaluated using out-of-sample metrics appropriate for multiclass classification, and interpretability is discussed in the context of public health risk stratification.\n",
    "\n",
    "All findings are interpreted within an **associational and observational framework**, acknowledging the self-reported nature of the data and the cross-sectional survey design. The notebook emphasizes methodological transparency and reproducibility, making it suitable for educational, exploratory, and policy-oriented analytical settings.\n"

    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiclass models** using survey-only BRFSS features achieve **macro AUC=0.76** across 253K U.S. adults (2015), with Random Forest attaining peak **diabetes recall=0.69** and Gradient Boosting optimal **prediabetes recall=0.29**. Formal hypothesis testing rejects H₀ (LR=36,304, p<0.0001), confirming **hypertension OR=2.50**, **age OR=1.14 per category**, **BMI OR=1.07 per unit** as strongest risk gradients. Prediabetes detection remains constrained (1.8% prevalence) despite leakage-controlled pipeline, stratified CV, and class weighting—quantifying self-reported survey data's realistic limits absent clinical biomarkers. Framework establishes production-grade benchmarks for population health risk stratification."

    "## Dataset Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the largest continuously conducted health survey in the world, collecting standardized self-reported data from U.S. adults on health behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive practices. The 2015 Diabetes Health Indicators subset provides a curated selection of variables commonly used in diabetes surveillance and risk modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset’s large sample size and population-level coverage make it particularly well suited for **predictive modeling and classification tasks** in public health research. While BRFSS data do not include clinical measurements or longitudinal follow-up, their breadth and consistency support analyses aimed at identifying **risk patterns, behavioral correlates, and demographic disparities** in chronic disease prevalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dataset is fully de-identified and publicly available, it supports ethical use, reproducibility, and transparency in data science workflows.\n"

    "## Relevance of Diabetes Status as a Classification Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes status is a core outcome in public health and epidemiological research due to its high prevalence, long-term health consequences, and strong associations with modifiable behavioral risk factors. Classifying individuals (target variable: `Diabetes_012`) into **no diabetes (0), prediabetes (1), and diabetes (2)** enables a more nuanced understanding of disease progression and risk stratification than binary outcomes alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In survey-based datasets such as BRFSS, diabetes status is systematically recorded using standardized questions and coding, ensuring consistency across respondents. Although self-reported, diabetes status has been shown to be a reliable proxy for diagnosed disease in population studies and is widely used in surveillance and predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a methodological perspective, the three-class structure of the target variable presents a realistic and meaningful **multiclass classification problem**, allowing for evaluation of model performance under class imbalance and overlapping risk profiles."

    "## Analytical Framework and Research Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This study adopts a **quantitative, observational, cross-sectional research design** based on population-level survey data from the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 – Diabetes Health Indicators** dataset. The primary objective is to develop a **reproducible data preprocessing, feature curation, and predictive modeling pipeline** suitable for classifying individuals’ diabetes status using behavioral, demographic, and self-reported health variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytical framework is explicitly **associational and predictive rather than causal**. No attempt is made to estimate structural relationships, causal mechanisms, or treatment effects linking risk factors to diabetes outcomes. Model parameters, feature importance measures, and performance metrics are interpreted descriptively and heuristically, with the goal of identifying predictive signal and illustrating methodological considerations in population health modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis proceeds through the following structured stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data ingestion and structural inspection**  \n",
    "   Importation of the BRFSS dataset, verification of variable types, dimensionality, and initial target distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data quality diagnostics**  \n",
    "   Assessment of missingness, class imbalance, implausible values, and survey-specific coding conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cleaning and transformation**  \n",
    "   Recoding of categorical variables, handling of missing values, and normalization or scaling of numeric features where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Target definition and leakage prevention**  \n",
    "   Formal specification of the multiclass diabetes outcome (0 = no diabetes, 1 = prediabetes, 2 = diabetes) and exclusion of variables that directly encode or trivially reveal the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature curation and engineering**  \n",
    "   Construction of analytically meaningful predictors, including derived indicators related to health behaviors, general health status, and access to care.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  \n",
    "   Descriptive and graphical analysis to characterize variable distributions, class-specific patterns, and preliminary associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Predictive modeling**  \n",
    "   Implementation and comparison of supervised learning algorithms suitable for multiclass classification, with model training conducted using stratified data splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Model evaluation and performance comparison**  \n",
    "   Assessment of out-of-sample performance using metrics appropriate for imbalanced multiclass classification, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Interpretation and limitations**  \n",
    "   Contextual interpretation of model behavior and performance, with explicit discussion of data limitations, observational bias, and generalizability constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although parametric and non-parametric classification models are employed, the primary objective of this study is **predictive performance and methodological transparency**, not causal or explanatory inference. The analysis seeks to evaluate how effectively routinely collected, self-reported population health indicators can be used to classify diabetes status, rather than to infer etiological pathways or clinical risk estimates.\n"

    "### Outcome Proximity, Predictor Eligibility, and Leakage Control\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize semantic target leakage and preserve the interpretability of the classification task, predictor eligibility was determined based on conceptual proximity to the outcome rather than solely on statistical association. Given the cross-sectional and self-reported nature of the BRFSS 2015 Diabetes Health Indicators dataset, special attention was paid to excluding variables that directly encode diabetes status or reflect downstream consequences of a diabetes diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable **`Diabetes_012`**, which categorizes respondents as having no diabetes, prediabetes, or diabetes, was used exclusively as the outcome and was not eligible for inclusion as a predictor by definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, variables representing medical conditions that are commonly understood as **complications or sequelae of diabetes** were excluded from the primary predictive models. These outcome-proximal variables include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Stroke`**\n",
    "- **`HeartDiseaseorAttack`**\n",
    "- **`KidneyDisease`**\n",
    "\n",
    "While these conditions are strongly correlated with diabetes status and may improve apparent classification performance, their inclusion would introduce post-diagnosis information and shift the analytical objective toward identifying individuals with established disease rather than modeling upstream risk factors. Excluding these variables therefore supports a preventive, population-level risk classification framework and reduces the likelihood of tautological prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "All remaining variables were retained based on their plausibility as demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, or general health indicators that may plausibly precede or co-occur with diabetes risk. This conceptual filtering ensures that model performance reflects meaningful predictive signal derived from non-diagnostic survey data rather than outcome-adjacent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "All variable inclusion and exclusion decisions were applied consistently across models and are documented transparently, with results interpreted under an associational framework appropriate to the observational and cross-sectional design of the BRFSS dataset.\n"

This indicates that a slightly lower threshold for prediabetes improves sensitivity without severely affecting the other classes.  \n",

The results confirm that class weighting and threshold optimization are essential strategies when predicting rare outcomes in survey-based datasets.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- Severe class imbalance (1.8% of dataset).  \n",
    "- Overlapping risk profiles with diabetes/no-diabetes.  \n",
    "- Moderate separability of self-reported predictors.  \n",

    "1. **Model:** HistGradientBoostingClassifier with inverse-frequency class weights.  \n",
    "2. **Stratified 5-Fold CV:** Preserves outcome distribution per fold.  \n",
    "3. **Threshold Optimization:** Prediabetes probability threshold tuned per fold to maximize macro F1.  \n",
